## üìò Course Description

Elevate your web development skills beyond the browser! This course encompasses everything needed to craft a #1 top-rated desktop app.

**Electron** offers a refined solution for designing desktop-based applications using familiar web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Widely adopted by renowned apps like Atom, Slack, and Discord, Electron is a testament to the possibilities of web-to-desktop.

**Desktop Development?** The recent shift from desktop to mobile has opened up vast opportunities for desktop application development. With minimal competition, even a few days of effort can land you on the front page of the MacOS store - a feat unimaginable in the mobile realm.

## üöÄ Projects You'll Develop

1. **Video File Analyzer**: Dive into Electron by building a tool to analyze video files using the FFMPEG CLI tool. Acquaint yourself with Electron's basics and understand the foundational architecture of an Electron app.
2. **Cross Window Todo List**: Yes, another todo app, but with a twist! Understand how to handle multiple windows with Electron, customize the top menu bar, and ensure a seamless experience across MacOS and Windows.
3. **System Tray Timer**: Create a classic system-tray based application. This will equip you with the skills to make Electron apps that users mistake for native ones.
4. **Video File Converter**: Design a video conversion tool - a handy app with equivalent features that command a $10 price on the MacOS store.
